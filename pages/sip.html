        <p>
            My project involves developing a program designed to convert fully 3D-rendered models into 2D animations. This software focuses specifically on frame-by-frame conversion, enabling seamless transformation of 3D animations into high-quality 2D images. The primary innovation of this software is its ability to convert entire 3D animations into 2D format. Users can create or import a 3D model, select a specific viewing angle, and initiate the animation. The program then processes the animation frame by frame, analyzing and converting each frame into a 2D image. Finally, it compiles these frames into a complete 2D animation, faithfully capturing the motion and perspective of the original 3D sequence.

        <p>
            Converting 3D animations into 2D animations based on a specific point of view configured by the user. The software processes each frame individually, transforming the 3D animation into a 2D format while maintaining the selected perspective throughout the sequence.
