                <p class="innovative-claim">Converting 3D animations into 2D animations based on a specific point of view configured by the user. The software processes each frame individually, transforming the 3D animation into a 2D format while maintaining the selected perspective throughout the sequence.

            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
                The primary innovation of this software is its ability to convert entire 3D animations into 2D format. Users can create or import a 3D model, select a specific viewing angle, and initiate the animation. The program then processes the animation frame by frame, analyzing and converting each frame into a 2D image. Finally, it compiles these frames into a complete 2D animation, faithfully capturing the motion and perspective of the original 3D sequence.

                    The 32C project is nearing completion, with its core functionality fully established. It now possesses the foundational capability to transform 3D animations into their stylized 2D counterparts. The stylization process is in its final stages, requiring only a few more days of training to refine. Additionally, a bonus feature is being integrated, enabling text-based inputs to generate this process, further enhancing the project's scope beyond its original objectives. A prototype is finished and a functional product is ready, however what I have now will change in the next couple days to fit a more stylistic approach to better show off the programs abilities.

                    Succesfully having it apply the filters consitently and cut the load time in half. We are on the way to completing a prototype and achieving a multi filter compile of styles and filters to get a finished video output>. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3koCCeSaVUyrRo3N2gHrd8?si=1c0bd9b6c6e444e9">Video</a>
